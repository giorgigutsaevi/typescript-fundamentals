# TypeScript Fundamentals

This repo acts as a refresher to get back to when dealing with TypeScript. 

I will document my journey of learning typescript here and include all kinds of notes and code examples. 

All my notes on TypeScript will be in .md format. 

Code snippets can be found in the **src/** directory. 

## TS with Node + Express - restAPI 
The repo also featues a small code example (ts-node-express directory) of how to use TS with NODE + Express - basically creating a restAPI with TypeScript

### NestJS - A progressive framework for Node that embraces TypeScript
For more examples on how to work with projects based on TS + Node + Express, check out [Nest.JS Framework](https://nestjs.com/).


## TS with React
To create a brand new TypeScript template react application out of the box, we can follow the instructions on the official create-react-app [website](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/).

The below command will give yield a project that has full typescript support.

```tsx
npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
```
